## 🔧 Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following commands:

- `npm start`: Runs the app in development mode.  
  Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
- `npm test`: Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.
- `npm run build`: Builds the app for production to the `build/` folder.  
  It optimizes the build for the best performance and minifies the code.
